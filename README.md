# gray_scale_converter
Program that batch processes several images, and creates and saves new images (with new filenames) that are grayscale versions of each image

Allows the user to select multiple image files
For each image, creates a new image that is a grayscale version of the original image
For each image, saves the grayscale image in a new file with the same filename as the original image, but with the word “gray-” in front of the filename. For example, if the original file was named lion.png, the new image would be a grayscale image and be named gray-lion.png.
